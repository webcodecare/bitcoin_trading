## Current Authentication System

**Note**: The project documents mention Supabase authentication, but the current implementation uses:
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control (admin/user roles)
- Session storage in PostgreSQL with connect-pg-simple
- Manual user registration and login system

**Supabase Integration**: To implement Supabase authentication as mentioned in the project documents, we would need to:
1. Replace the current JWT auth system with Supabase Auth
2. Update the user schema to match Supabase user structure  
3. Implement row-level security (RLS) policies
4. Update all auth-related frontend components

## Complete Admin Module System

Based on the attached project documents, the platform now includes all required admin modules:

### Core Admin Modules
- **User Management** (`/admin/users`) - CRUD operations for users, role management
- **Ticker Management** (`/admin/tickers`) - Enable/disable trading pairs, control chart availability
